This Chrome extension (“the Extension”) is designed to enhance your browsing experience while respecting your privacy.
We are committed to protecting your personal information and complying with all applicable privacy and data-protection regulations, including the GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).

## 1. Information We Collect

This Extension does NOT collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data.

- We do not collect your browsing history.
- We do not collect personally identifiable information (PII).
- We do not transfer any data to external servers.
- We do not use analytics, tracking, or advertising networks.

> All operations performed by the Extension take place locally on your device.

## 2. Usage of Permissions

The Extension may request certain Chrome permissions strictly for functional reasons.
These permissions are used only on pages where you explicitly activate the extension, and no data is ever transmitted externally.

- **activeTab**: Used only when you interact with the extension to apply functionality to the current tab.

No data is sent to:

- External APIs
